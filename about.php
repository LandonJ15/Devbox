                    <p>Welcome to my page about me! I'll try to explain my wierd self as well as I can.</p>
                    <p>In this first paragraph I'll talk about myself and my interests. I'm fifteen years old and my birthday is on July third. I've always loved animals, especially dogs. I have a dog (his name is Cub) and I also have a lot of chickens. (I won't list all of their names here, it would take up too much paragraph space, but I'll say mine, whose name is Willow) I really enjoy sports, especially soccer and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. I also do running but I'm not going to say that I particularly like running! I enjoy biking, but I don’t do it very often. I find a lot of interest in books, and not just little books. I'll read a book with hundreds of pages in a single night, and then the next morning I’m exhausted and can barely function. A lot of the things that I love to do I’ll do with my siblings (I have six) especially Marshall because he’s the closest to my age. </p>
                    <p>In this second paragraph I’ll get a little more in depth about some of the things I listed before and just about my general life. I said in the last paragraph that I do Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (henceforth called BJJ). BJJ does NOT contain any striking. It’s all grappling. BJJ is about technique, not who can hit the other guy harder. It’s not like wrestling either, because in BJJ it isn’t over even if you’re pinned. My dog Cub is a Goldendoodle (a poodle mixed with a golden retriever) who is really lazy and loves to sleep. I love him to death (to the point that he’s spoiled and a bit fat) But at least he isn’t a troublemaker. That just about sums up everything you need to know about me, but if you want to reach me to learn more, my socials are below.</p>
